1) # split the fasta protein sequences into individual protein fasta sequence;
# the split_fasta.pls is attached in the multigene family search folder.

perl split_fasta.pl -i input.fasta -o result.txt -n 1

2) # build the whole protein sequences index

makeblastdb -dbtype prot -in Bd_protein.fasta

3) # run blast p using the individual protein sequence against the whole protein sequences; e value is smaller than e-10.

for file in ~/Desktop/Mary_blastp/input/*

  blastp -query $file -db Bd_protein.fasta  -evalue 0.0000000001 -out $file.out

4)# after the run, check the file size and set the file size you think that will contain multigene family hits. 30k for my case.

 find . -type f -size +30k -exec cp -nv {} ../30kplus/ \
5)# compress the file if you want to.

 tar -cvzf 30kplus.tar.gz 30kplus


PS: top // check running or not "q" to quit
    ls -lh // check the size of the files in a folder
    find . -type f -size -10k // just for display the file size that is smaller than 10k
